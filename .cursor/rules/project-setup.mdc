# Dependencies and Assets

- **Dependencies:** Project dependencies are managed using pnpm. See [package.json](mdc:package.json) for the list of dependencies and scripts. The exact versions are locked in [pnpm-lock.yaml](mdc:pnpm-lock.yaml).
- **Static Assets:** Static files like images and fonts (if not using `next/font`) are served from the `public/` directory.
- **Global Styles:** Base global styles, Tailwind directives, and custom CSS classes are in [app/globals.css](mdc:app/globals.css).
